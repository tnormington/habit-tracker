  "summary": "## Summary: Add frequency badge to all habits\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Modified the `HabitCard` component to show a frequency badge on **all** habits (previously only showed for non-daily habits)\n- Created `getFrequencyLabel()` function that returns appropriate labels:\n  - Daily habits: \"Daily\"\n  - Weekly habits: \"Nx/week\" (e.g., \"3x/week\" for a habit with targetCount of 3)\n  - Monthly habits: \"Nx/month\" (e.g., \"5x/month\" for a habit with targetCount of 5)\n- Removed the conditional check that hid the badge for daily habits\n- Badge uses the existing blue styling and includes appropriate calendar icons for each frequency type\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCard.tsx` - Added `getFrequencyLabel()` function and updated badge to always display with target count information\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The badge styling remains consistent with the existing design (blue rounded pill with icon)\n- The `targetCount` property is used to display how many times per week/month the habit should be completed\n- Falls back to `1` if `targetCount` is not set\n- TypeScript check passed with no errors"
