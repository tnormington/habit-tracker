  "summary": "## Summary: Implement Click-to-Toggle Functionality on Card Component\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Added `handleCardClick` function that toggles habit completion when clicking anywhere on the card\n- Added `handleKeyDown` function for keyboard accessibility (Space/Enter keys trigger toggle)\n- Made the entire card visually interactive with `cursor-pointer` and `select-none` classes\n- Added hover feedback with `hover:border-primary/50` and `hover:bg-muted/30` \n- Added active state animation with `active:scale-[0.99]` for tactile feedback\n- Added focus-visible ring styles for keyboard navigation (`focus-visible:ring-2`)\n- Added proper ARIA attributes: `role=\"checkbox\"`, `aria-checked`, and descriptive `aria-label`\n- Made card focusable with `tabIndex={0}`\n- Protected against unintended toggles by checking if click target is a link, button, or element with `role=\"button\"`\n- Made the checkbox visual-only (`aria-hidden=\"true\"`, `tabIndex={-1}`) since the card now handles interaction\n- Updated transition from `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-200` for smoother animations\n- Maintained special hover styling for period-reached state (green border)\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/DailyCheckIn.tsx` - Modified `HabitCheckInItem` component (lines 96-189)\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The checkbox still works if clicked directly (both the card and checkbox trigger the toggle)\n- Keyboard users can tab to each card and press Space or Enter to toggle\n- Screen readers will announce the card as a checkbox with the habit name and current state\n- If nested interactive elements are added in the future (links, buttons), they won't trigger the card toggle\n- The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and uses the existing `cn()` utility and Tailwind classes"
