  "summary": "## Summary: Update the target slider track background color to blue\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Updated the slider track background gradient color from the dark primary color to blue (oklch(0.6 0.118 184.704))\n- The filled portion of the slider now displays in blue, making the target slider more visually distinct\n- The unfilled portion remains as the secondary color (light gray) for contrast\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/ui/slider.tsx` - Updated the linear-gradient background style on line 86 to use the blue color for the filled track portion\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The blue color used (`oklch(0.6 0.118 184.704)`) is the `--chart-2` color from the design system's color palette, ensuring consistency with the overall design\n- The change applies to all slider instances in the application (target count sliders in habit creation and editing forms)\n- TypeScript compilation verified successfully with no errors\n- Changes have been committed to git with commit ID: feda936",
