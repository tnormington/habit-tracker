  "summary": "## Summary: Icon Grid Selector for Habit Categories\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Created a new `CategoryIconGrid` component that displays a 3x3 grid of category options with icons\n- Created centralized habit display constants (`habit-display.tsx`) following DRY principles to reduce code duplication\n- Replaced the dropdown `<Select>` component with the visual icon grid in both HabitCreationForm and HabitEditFormDialog\n- Added category icons to the HabitCard badge display\n- Each category now has a distinct icon:\n  - Health: Heart\n  - Fitness: Dumbbell\n  - Productivity: Target\n  - Mindfulness: Brain\n  - Learning: BookOpen\n  - Social: Users\n  - Finance: DollarSign\n  - Creativity: Palette\n  - Other: MoreHorizontal\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/CategoryIconGrid.tsx` (new file)\n- `src/lib/constants/habit-display.tsx` (new file)\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCreationForm.tsx`\n- `src/components/habits/HabitEditFormDialog.tsx`\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCard.tsx`\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The icon grid uses a responsive 3x3 layout that fits all 9 categories\n- Icons are from lucide-react (already in use throughout the codebase)\n- The centralized constants file can be used by other components to avoid duplication\n- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors"
