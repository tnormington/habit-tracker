  "summary": "## Summary: Add a darkmode theme with light/dark/system toggle\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Created `ThemeProvider` context that manages theme state (light, dark, or system)\n- Theme persists in localStorage with key `habit-tracker-theme`\n- System theme detection using `prefers-color-scheme` media query\n- Real-time updates when system theme changes (when using \"system\" mode)\n- `ThemeToggle` component with visual selection UI showing icon, label, and description for each option\n- Integrated theme toggle into the Settings page under the \"Appearance\" card\n- System default is used on first visit (before user makes a choice)\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/theme/theme-provider.tsx` (new) - Theme context and provider with localStorage persistence\n- `src/components/theme/theme-toggle.tsx` (new) - Visual toggle component with light/dark/system options\n- `src/components/theme/index.ts` (new) - Barrel export for theme components\n- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ThemeProvider wrapper and suppressHydrationWarning\n- `src/app/settings/page.tsx` - Added ThemeToggle to Appearance card\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The dark mode CSS variables were already defined in `globals.css` under the `.dark` class - no CSS changes needed\n- Theme is applied by adding `light` or `dark` class to the `<html>` element\n- The `useTheme` hook can be used anywhere in the app to access current theme or change it programmatically\n- Build passes successfully with no TypeScript errors"
