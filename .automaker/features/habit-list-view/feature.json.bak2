  "summary": "## Summary: Create habit list view component displaying all active habits\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Created HabitCard component with name, type indicator (positive/negative badge), category badge, color indicator bar, and quick action buttons (complete, archive, edit)\n- Created HabitFilters component with type filter buttons (Build/Break) and category filter buttons for all 9 categories, with toggle and clear functionality\n- Created HabitSearch component with instant search input, clear button, and placeholder text\n- Created HabitEmptyState component handling three states: no-habits (with create button), no-results (for search), and filtered-empty (with clear filters button)\n- Created HabitListView component combining search, filters, loading state, empty state, habit cards grid, and results count\n- Integrated HabitListView into the habits page with header, \"Add Habit\" button, and proper callbacks\n- Added Select and Textarea UI components from shadcn/ui (used by HabitCreationForm)\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCard.tsx` - New component for habit cards\n- `src/components/habits/HabitFilters.tsx` - New component for type and category filtering\n- `src/components/habits/HabitSearch.tsx` - New component for search functionality\n- `src/components/habits/HabitEmptyState.tsx` - New component for empty state UI\n- `src/components/habits/HabitListView.tsx` - New main component combining all parts\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCreationForm.tsx` - New component for habit creation (bonus)\n- `src/components/habits/index.ts` - Barrel export file\n- `src/app/habits/page.tsx` - Updated to integrate HabitListView\n- `src/components/ui/select.tsx` - New shadcn/ui Select component\n- `src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` - New shadcn/ui Textarea component\n\n### Verification Status\n- TypeScript compilation passed without errors\n- Playwright verification could not be completed due to npm installation issues on Windows (TAR_ENTRY_ERROR file extraction problems)\n- Code review confirms all components have proper data-testid attributes for testing\n- All components follow existing codebase patterns and use existing UI primitives\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The npm/node_modules on this Windows machine has file system issues that prevented running the dev server and Playwright tests\n- Running `npm cache clean --force` and reinstalling may help resolve npm issues\n- The feature is code-complete and TypeScript-verified\n- Quick action buttons (complete, archive, edit) are connected to callbacks but will need full implementation for habit logging in future features\n- Git commit created: `63c6ccc feat(habits): Create habit list view with filtering and search`"
