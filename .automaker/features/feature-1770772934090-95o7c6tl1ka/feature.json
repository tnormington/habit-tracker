  "summary": "## Summary: View Archived Habits and Update Card Icons\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Added Active/Archived toggle buttons in `HabitListView` to allow users to switch between viewing active habits and archived habits\n- Removed the delete (trash) icon button from `HabitCard`\n- Changed the edit pen icon to an ellipsis (more options) icon on `HabitCard`\n- Added a restore button (RotateCcw icon) that appears on archived habit cards to allow users to restore them\n- Added a new 'no-archived' empty state message for when no archived habits exist\n- Removed the `onArchive` prop from `HabitCard` since archiving will be handled elsewhere (through the options menu)\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCard.tsx` - Updated icons (MoreHorizontal, RotateCcw), removed onArchive prop, added onRestore prop\n- `src/components/habits/HabitListView.tsx` - Added showArchived state and toggle buttons, added handleRestore function\n- `src/components/habits/HabitEmptyState.tsx` - Added 'no-archived' empty state type with Archive icon\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The ellipsis button now calls `onEdit` to open the options menu (same behavior as before)\n- Archived habits display with reduced opacity (60%) as before\n- The restore functionality uses `updateHabit` with `{ isArchived: false }` to restore habits\n- Users can now view their archived habits by clicking the \"Archived\" toggle button in the habits list view"
