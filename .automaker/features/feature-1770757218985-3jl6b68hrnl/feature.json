  "summary": "## Summary: In the habits page, remove the \"mark as complete\" button....\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Removed the \"mark as complete\" (CheckCircle) button from the HabitCard component\n- Added a large habit type icon on the left side of each card using `TYPE_ICONS` from the constants\n- Icon displays TrendingUp for positive habits, Minus for neutral habits, and TrendingDown for negative habits\n- Applied appropriate color styling for each type (green for positive, gray for neutral, red for negative)\n- Removed the redundant type badge since the large icon now visually indicates the habit type\n- Cleaned up unused imports (CheckCircle, TrendingUp, TrendingDown from lucide-react)\n- Updated the component to properly support all three habit types (positive, neutral, negative)\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCard.tsx`\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The `onComplete` prop is still accepted by the component interface but is no longer used - can be removed from the interface and parent components if desired\n- The `COLOR_CLASSES` constant is now unused in the component (was used for the color indicator bar) - can be cleaned up if not needed elsewhere\n- Dark mode styling is preserved for all habit type icons",
