  "summary": "## Summary: Habits to break should say 3/3 avoided when unchecked\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Fixed the \"Habits to Break\" section to correctly display the avoided count\n- For negative habits (habits to break), unchecked habits now count as \"avoided\" (success)\n- Previously the counter was showing 0/3 avoided even when all habits were unchecked, because it was counting habits where `completedHabitIds.has(h.id)` which only includes checked habits\n- Now the logic correctly inverts for negative habits: `!completedHabitIds.has(h.id)` counts unchecked habits as avoided\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/DailyCheckIn.tsx` - Updated `HabitGroup` component to correctly calculate `successCount` based on habit type (positive vs negative)\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- For positive habits: success = checked (completed)\n- For negative habits: success = unchecked (avoided)\n- The fix follows the existing pattern used in `periodProgressMap` and overall progress calculation in the same file"
