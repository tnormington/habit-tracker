  "summary": "## Summary: Fix habit type field default state\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Fixed the type field initialization to use `'positive'` as the default value instead of an empty string\n- Removed the fallback `|| 'positive'` from the ChoiceCardGroup value prop since the state is now always a valid HabitType\n- Updated the form reset logic to reset type to `'positive'` instead of empty string\n\n### Files Modified\n- `src/components/habits/HabitCreationForm.tsx`\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- The bug was caused by a mismatch between visual display (which showed 'positive' via fallback) and actual form state (which was empty)\n- The validation check `if (!type)` will now never trigger since type always has a valid value, but was left in place as a safety check"
