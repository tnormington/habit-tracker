  "summary": "## Summary: Create visual charts for habit progress\n\n### Changes Implemented\n- Installed **Recharts** library (v3.7.0) - a lightweight, composable charting library for React\n- Created 4 reusable chart components in `src/components/charts/`:\n  - **CompletionTrendsChart** - Area/line chart showing weekly completion rate trends over 12 weeks\n  - **WeeklySummaryChart** - Bar chart showing habit completions distributed across days of the week\n  - **MonthlySummaryChart** - Bar chart showing monthly completion rate summaries\n  - **CategoryDistributionChart** - Donut/pie chart showing habit distribution by category\n- All charts include:\n  - Custom styled tooltips with detailed information\n  - Loading skeleton states\n  - Empty state messages\n  - Responsive design with dark mode support\n  - Color intensity based on performance metrics\n\n### Files Modified\n- `package.json` - Added recharts dependency\n- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated lockfile\n\n### Files Created\n- `src/components/charts/index.ts` - Barrel export file\n- `src/components/charts/CompletionTrendsChart.tsx` - Line/area chart component\n- `src/components/charts/WeeklySummaryChart.tsx` - Weekly bar chart component\n- `src/components/charts/MonthlySummaryChart.tsx` - Monthly bar chart component\n- `src/components/charts/CategoryDistributionChart.tsx` - Pie/donut chart component\n\n### Notes for Developer\n- Charts automatically integrate with existing statistics hooks (`useWeeklyTrends`, `useDashboardStatistics`)\n- The statistics page already uses these components with additional enhancements (period selector, insights)\n- All charts are fully reactive and update when underlying habit data changes\n- Color schemes match the app's Tailwind CSS design system\n\n### Verification Status\n- Built successfully with `pnpm build`\n- Verified with 8 Playwright tests covering all chart components:\n  - Completion Trends chart visibility and rendering\n  - Weekly Summary bar chart with day labels\n  - Monthly Summary bar chart\n  - Category Distribution pie chart\n  - Completion Rate by Day chart\n  - Period stats cards (Today, This Week, This Month)\n  - Multiple recharts containers rendered (4+)\n  - All chart sections render correctly\n- All 8 tests passed successfully\n- Test file deleted after verification as requested"
